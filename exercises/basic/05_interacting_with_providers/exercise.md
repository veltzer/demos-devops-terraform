# Exercise #5: Interacting with Providers

Providers are plugins that Terraform uses to understand various external APIs and cloud providers.  Thus far in this workshop, we've used the AWS provider. In this exercise, we're going to modify the AWS provider we've been using to create a key pair in a different region.

### Add the second provider

Add this variable stanza to the "variables.tf" file:

```hcl
variable "region_alt" {
  default = "us-west-2"
}
```

Then, add the new variable reference to `main.tf` in the existing provider stanza:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  version = "~> 2.0"
  # the following is the line to add
  region = "${var.region_alt}"
}
```

Now, lets provision and bring up a key pair is this alternate region:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
terraform show
```
The above should show that you have a key pair `rockholla-di-[your student alias]` that was created. The terraform resource/state itself doesn't actually tell us what region where the key pair lives, but you could easily verify that it was created in the expected region by visiting the appropriate console location: [https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#KeyPairs:](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#KeyPairs:)

*NOTE:* that at the beginning of our course we set the `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable in your Cloud9 environment. Along with this variable and the access key and secret key, terraform is able to use these environment variables for the AWS provider as defaults **unless you override them in the HCL provider stanza** which is exactly what we just did.

We'll be looking more at using providers in other exercises as we move along.

### Finishing this exercise

Let's run the following to finish:

```
terraform destroy
```
